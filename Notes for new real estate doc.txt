https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/

LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1E5tx4yrPAaWSL5I8laApisUQ9gw_dbKZ' AS line
WITH line
WHERE line.Latitude IS NOT NULL AND line.Longitude IS NOT NULL
MERGE (property:Property {
    serialNumber: line.`Serial Number`,
    listYear: toInteger(line.`List Year`),
    dateRecorded: line.`Date Recorded`,
    town: line.Town,
    address: line.Address,
    assessedValue: toInteger(line.`Assessed Value`),
    saleAmount: toInteger(line.`Sale Amount`),
    salesRatio: toFloat(line.`Sales Ratio`),
    propertyType: line.`Property Type`,
    residentialType: line.`Residential Type`
})
SET property.location = point({latitude: toFloat(line.Latitude), longitude: toFloat(line.Longitude)})
